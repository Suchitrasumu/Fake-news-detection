## 📖 Overview

Fake news has become a major issue in today's digital age. This project aims to help combat misinformation by providing an automated system to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using machine learning techniques.

The core idea is to train a classifier on labeled news data and then use it to predict the authenticity of new articles.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Flask (for web app, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)

## 📊 Dataset

We use the **Fake and Real News Dataset** available on Kaggle:  
[Fake and real news dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

- `Fake.csv` — contains fake news articles
- `True.csv` — contains real news articles

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
